    "bio": "I am a final-year PhD at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eUbmKwYAAAAJ'>Prof. Bingbing Ni</a>. I received BEng and MEng degrees from the same university, and a double master's degree in France. I was a visiting research fellow in the <a href='https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/'>Visual Computing Group</a> at Harvard University. I am now visiting EPFL, Switzerland, working with <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua'>Prof. Pascal Fua</a>. I have authored 30+ papers on prestigious journals/conferences, e.g., Cancer Research, eBioMedicine, CVPR, MICCAI, NeurIPS, ICCV, and ICLR. I have been a reviewer for 10+ top-tier venues, a top-ranking participant for several AI competitions, and the lead organizer for <a href='https://ribfrac.grand-challenge.org/'>MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge</a>. My research interests center around the interdisciplinary field of medical image analysis and 3D computer vision. Currently, I have been primarily investigating geometric deep learning in biomedical applications.",
