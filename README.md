I focus on medical image analysis, 3D computer vision and truthworthy artificial intelligence. I have (co-)first-authored 10+ papers on prestigious venues, e.g., Cancer Research, EBioMedicine, CVPR, MICCAI, NeurIPS, one of which was selected as cover article. I served as reviewers for top venues, and I was awarded BMVC Outstanding Reviewer. As participants, I top-ranked in several AI competitions; As lead organizer, I hosted MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge.
