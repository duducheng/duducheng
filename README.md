# Bio.
I focus on medical image analysis, 3D computer vision and truthworthy artificial intelligence. I have published 10+ research papers on prestigious venues, e.g., Cancer Research (IF=9.130), CVPR, MICCAI and ICCV, one of which was selected as cover article. I top-ranked in several AI competitions, and served as reviewers for top conferences and journals. I was awarded China National PhD Scholarship, Chinese Government Scholarship (i.e., CSC), MICCAI Student Travel Award and BMVC Outstanding Reviewer Award. This year, I am hosing MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge as the lead organizer.
